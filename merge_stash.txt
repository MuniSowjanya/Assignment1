From the given images, the first image is merge and second image is stash

1.The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. ... Again, this means that git merge is often used in conjunction with git checkout for selecting the current branch and git branch -d for deleting the obsolete target branch.
 
2.In Git, the stash operation takes your modified tracked files, stages changes, and saves them on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.
